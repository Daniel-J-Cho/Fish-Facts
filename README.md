# fish-facts

A dynamic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript web application for people who want to view images and learn about 110+ species of fish.

The main reason why I wanted to build this project was because I wanted to learn more about fish species myself.  And with the public API at https://www.fishwatch.gov/api/species, which holds images and facts of more than 110 different species, I thought this would be a cool and useful project for myself and others who want to learn about a variety of fish species.
